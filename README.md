# gifLib
#### Spring MVC Framework

> This is my first web application using Java and the Spring MVC Framework. Below there are picture of the applciation
 made by me with the guidance of teamtreehouse.com.
> The idea of this app is to dynamically display a list of gif for the user and use filters to display a list of gifs by
 different categories. It also shows a list of GIFs marked as favorite in the favorites section.
